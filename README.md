I still plan to finish this project, and update it to Forge or something if possible, but don't hold your breath.

This mod adds the Druid class to the game, based upon the specification laid out with the ClassesMod description.

Druids can heal themselves or other players using a special healing bark or perform fancy tricks with a magical leaf.  They can climb trees with ease.  They can also have a wolf familiar that follows them everywhere and can attach for them, which will never die.

Requires ModLoader.
