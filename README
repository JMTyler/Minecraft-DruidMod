This mod adds the Druid class to the game, based upon the specification laid out with the ClassesMod description.

Druids can heal themselves or other players using a special healing bark or perform fancy tricks with a magical leaf.  They can climb trees with ease.  They can also have a wolf familiar that follows them everywhere and can attach for them, which will never die.

Requires ModLoader.
